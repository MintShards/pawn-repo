# Spec Kit Integration Guide for Pawn-Repo

This guide explains how to use GitHub's Spec Kit for Spec-Driven Development in your pawn-repo project.

## Overview

Spec Kit enables "executable specifications" where specifications directly generate working implementations. This approach emphasizes intent-driven development where specifications define the "what" before the "how".

## Available Commands

### `/specify` - Create Feature Specifications
Use this command to create business-focused specifications for new features:

```bash
# Example usage in Claude Code
/specify customer loyalty program with point tracking and rewards
```

**Output**: Creates a new specification in `spec-kit/specs/` following the business-focused template.

### `/plan` - Generate Technical Implementation Plans  
Converts specifications into detailed technical implementation plans:

```bash
# After creating a spec, generate the technical plan
/plan customer-loyalty-program.md
```

**Output**: Creates technical plan in `spec-kit/plans/` with architecture, database design, API endpoints, and implementation details.

### `/tasks` - Break Down into Development Tasks
Generates specific development tasks from implementation plans:

```bash
# Generate actionable tasks from technical plan
/tasks customer-loyalty-technical-plan.md
```

**Output**: Creates task breakdown in `spec-kit/tasks/` with development priorities and dependencies.

## Workflow Integration

    A[Business Need Identified] --> B[/specify new-feature]

    D --> E[Review Technical Plan]
    E --> F[/tasks technical-plan.md]
    F --> G[Implement Tasks]
    G --> H[Validate Against Spec]
```

### 2. Constitution-Driven Development
All specifications and plans must comply with your pawn-repo constitution:
- Business-first development with measurable value
- Security & compliance (non-negotiable)
- Test-first quality assurance (80%+ coverage)
- Async-first architecture patterns
- Production-ready operations

### 3. Quality Gates Integration
Spec Kit integrates with your existing quality gates:

1. **Specification Review**: Business stakeholders validate requirements
2. **Technical Plan Review**: Architecture team validates implementation approach  
3. **Task Breakdown Review**: Development team validates task estimates and dependencies
4. **Implementation Validation**: Code must pass all specification acceptance scenarios

## Example Workflow

### Creating a New Feature: Customer Loyalty Program

#### Step 1: Create Specification
```bash
/specify customer loyalty program with point tracking, tier levels, and reward redemption
```

This creates a business-focused specification covering:
- User scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements 
- Key entities and relationships
- Edge cases and error handling

#### Step 2: Generate Technical Plan
```bash
/plan customer-loyalty-program.md
```

This creates detailed technical implementation covering:
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint design
- Frontend component requirements
- Security considerations
- Performance implications

#### Step 3: Break Down Tasks
```bash
/tasks customer-loyalty-technical-plan.md
```

This creates actionable development tasks with:
- Priority ordering
- Dependency mapping
- Acceptance criteria per task
- Testing requirements

#### Step 4: Implementation
Develop tasks following your constitution principles:
- TDD with tests written first
- Async/await patterns
- Field-level encryption for customer data
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Service layer business logic

## Constitution Compliance

Every specification, plan, and task must align with your constitution:

### Business-First Development
- All features must serve measurable pawnshop business value
- Customer service enhancement
- Transaction efficiency improvement
- Operational risk reduction

### Security & Compliance (Non-Negotiable)
- Field-level encryption for PII data
- JWT authentication with PIN-based login
- Comprehensive audit trails for financial transactions
- No security compromises for convenience

### Test-First Quality Assurance (Non-Negotiable)
- TDD mandatory: Tests → User approval → Implementation
- 80%+ coverage requirement strictly enforced
- Integration tests for transaction workflows
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### Technical Standards Enforcement
- Async/await patterns throughout
- MongoDB + Beanie ODM for data layer
- FastAPI + React architecture
- <200ms API response time targets

## Best Practices

### 1. Specification Writing
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW implementation details
- Mark ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Write testable acceptance scenarios

### 2. Technical Planning  
- Follow established architecture patterns
- Consider security implications first
- Plan for monitoring and observability
- Design for business rule compliance

### 3. Task Breakdown
- Create small, testable increments
- Map dependencies clearly
- Include validation steps
- Estimate complexity realistically

### 4. Implementation Validation
- Validate against original specification
- Test all acceptance scenarios
- Ensure constitution compliance
- Complete quality gate checklist

## Integration with Claude Code

Spec Kit is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code:

1. **Type `/` in any file** to see available Spec Kit commands
2. **Use `/specify`** to create business-focused specifications  
3. **Use `/plan`** to generate technical implementation plans
4. **Use `/tasks`** to break down development work
5. **Reference constitution** during all phases for compliance

## Getting Started

1. **Review existing specifications** in `spec-kit/specs/` to understand current system
2. **Read the constitution** in `spec-kit/pawn-repo-constitution.md` for project principles
3. **Practice with small features** using the `/specify → /plan → /tasks` workflow
4. **Integrate with existing development** process and quality gates

## Benefits for Pawn-Repo

- **Clarity**: Business requirements clearly documented before implementation
- **Consistency**: All features follow same specification-first approach
- **Quality**: Built-in validation against business requirements
- **Traceability**: Clear path from business need to technical implementation
- **Compliance**: Built-in constitution compliance checking
- **Efficiency**: Reduced rework through upfront specification clarity

The Spec Kit framework ensures every feature adds measurable business value while maintaining the high security, quality, and performance standards required for pawnshop operations.
