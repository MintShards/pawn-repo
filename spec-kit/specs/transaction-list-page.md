## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Pawnshop staff need to quickly locate, review, and manage pawn transactions to serve customers efficiently and make informed business decisions. The transaction list provides a comprehensive overview of all loans with filtering and search capabilities to handle daily operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** staff opens transaction list, **When** page loads, **Then** displays all active transactions with key information (ID, customer, amount, status, due date)
2. **Given** staff needs specific transaction, **When** searches by customer name/phone/transaction ID, **Then** system filters list to matching results instantly
3. **Given** staff managing overdue accounts, **When** filters by "overdue" status, **Then** displays only transactions past maturity date sorted by days overdue
4. **Given** staff planning daily collections, **When** sorts by maturity date, **Then** transactions ordered chronologically showing upcoming due dates first
5. **Given** staff serving walk-in customer, **When** clicks transaction row, **Then** navigates to detailed transaction view with full history and payment options
6. **Given** staff reviewing business performance, **When** applies date range filter, **Then** shows transactions within specified loan date period with summary totals

### Edge Cases
- What happens when customer has multiple active transactions?
- How does system handle very large transaction lists (1000+ records)?
- What occurs when transaction status changes while viewing list?
- How are recently created transactions highlighted for staff attention?
- What safeguards prevent accidental bulk operations on transactions?
